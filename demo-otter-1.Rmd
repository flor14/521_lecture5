# Question 1.1.2.

Change the cell below by replacing the following code:

#### your code here
raise NotImplementedError # No Answer - remove if you provide an answer
with another print expression so that it prints out:

First this line is printed,        
then this one,
and then the whole üåè.

Hint: If you're stuck on how to print the Earth symbol, try looking at the print expressions above.
