## Lecture 4

1. Use git reset to move a branch back in the commit history.

--

2. Precisely match specific sequences of text strings using regex.


---

# TIME TRAVELLING
### with _git reset_

---

### Refer to a commit 

Commit ID or SHA-1 hash

```bash
commit b22d6421363c7b82e2b88b0b5f1f25edca703303

commit b22d
```

--

## `git log --oneline` 

```{r git_log, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE,out.width=700} 
knitr::include_graphics("img/gitlogid.png")
```


---

### Move to a previous commit

```bash
git reset <commit id>
```

**(1) This command changes the commit history**

.footnote[[Git Docs - Reset, restore and revert](https://git-scm.com/docs/git)]

---

### What happened to the changes? 

**(2) You can edit the changes**

We could now make any modification we wish and then commit again 

```{r obj4, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE,out.width=700} 
knitr::include_graphics("img/reset.png")
```



---

### What if we want to discard the changes instead of moving them to the working area?

```bash
git reset --hard <sha>
```
It will not show us any message, since the changes are not unstaged, they are **discarded**.

## SYNCING WITH A REMOTE AFTER RESETTING


---

### Git push

##### Git will refuse to push changes when the remote is ahead of the local branch.


```{r push, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE,out.width=700} 
knitr::include_graphics("img/gitpusherror.png")
```

To override this warning and force git to push to the remote
we can use the **-f/--force** flag.
---

## Danger Zone

```bash
git push -f/--force 
```

--
- Should never do this on the `main` branch of a repository that you **share with collaborators** unless you have all discussed this

--

- Everyone else who is using this repository are now **out of sync** with the `main` branch, since you have reset master to a previous state

--

**Safer**
: If you are working alone and you know what you are doing

# INTRODUCTION TO 
# REGULAR EXPRESIONS 
### regex

---

# .*

### A regular expression, often abbreviated to **regex**, is a method of using a sequence of characters to define a search to match strings, i.e. “find and replace”-like operations. 



.footnote[[Library Carpentries](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-data-intro/01-regular-expressions/)]
---

## JupyterLab and VS Code have built in regex functionality 
(Ctrl + F)


#### VSCode


```{r regex, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE,out.width=500} 
knitr::include_graphics("img/regex.png")
```
#### JupyterLab 
```{r regexjl, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE,out.width=500} 
knitr::include_graphics("img/jupyterLab.png")
```

---

## The square brackets: []

If you want to specify the set of possible characters you can use square brackets []


`[Aa]`pple 



--


#### - Find all the pairs of vowels in the fruit list.



.footnote[[Answers in Lecture4](https://pages.github.ubc.ca/mds-2021-22/DSCI_521_platforms-dsci_students/README.html)]

---

## Ranges within []

You can also define ranges when using brackets. 

--

`[A-Z]`: will match any upper case letter  
`[a-z]`: will match any lower case letter  
`[0-9]`: will match any digit  
`[0-5]`: will match any digit between 0 and 5  

--

.footnote[[Order based in ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters)]

---

## Ranges within []

You can use square brackets starting with a caret. 

`[^A-Z]`: will match anything that is not an upper case letter  
`[^0-9]`: will match anything that is not a digit


--

.footnote[Note that the caret needs to be inside the bracket, if it is outside it will match the beginning of a line as described under the "Anchors" section below.]

---

## Ranges within []

You can combine ranges: `[A-Za-z]`.   

#### - What is the difference between writing `[A-Za-z]` and `[A-z]`?

--

```
!"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~ 
```
> These ranges are ordered based on ASCI codes where every character is represented by a number.  
> The first character in the list is  (space) and the last is ~ (tilde). 


 `[A-z]` will also match the characters `[/]^_`, as you can see in the list above.  

---

## Special matching characters

**.** can be used to match any character in the list above

--

To match a **.**  prefacing it with a backslash `\.`

`\w`, which matches any character that normally occurs   
inside a word (`[A-Za-z0-9_]`)




---

## Anchors

- The **^** (caret) outside the brackets means beginning of line.
- The dollar sign **$** means end of line

Another useful anchor is `\b`, which matches end of word.

```{r regexdino, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE,out.width=500} 
knitr::include_graphics("img/regex.jpg")
```



---


## Repetitions

To match multiple of the same character, you can either repeat it or use the following syntax:

`{n}`: exactly n occurrences  
`{n,}`: at least n occurrences  
`{0,m}`: at most m occurrences  
`{n,m}`: between n and m (inclusive) occurrences  

--

#### - Find the fruits with names between 10 and 12 characters.
#### - Find the lines with no more than 4 letters

---


## Special repetition characters

There are some shortcuts for the most common repetitions:  
  
`?`: means 0 or 1 time ({0,1})   
`*`: means 0 or more time ({0,})   
`+`: means 1 or more time ({1,})  

--

na**?** will match _n_ or _na_.

na***** will match all of _n_, _na_, _naaa_, etc.

na**+** will match _na_ or _naaaa_, for example, but not _n_.



---

## Some practice

- Match any characters between two _.
- Find all the words that contain at least two consecutive vowels.
- This is a bit harder derives from all previous sections: Match entire words that end in _.
